This is a "Facebook Messenger Clone". 

I created this since The Messenger app is going extinxt in December.


It's basically just an app that opens a web page (messenger.com).
EVERYTHING was made by ChatGPT (because I don't know javascript).
I just gave the ideas to ChatGPT for example, for the context menu when u right click, and some other little things.

This is just a prefrence for me, but I made that the app automatically opens maximised on the second monitor (Idk how it'll work if u have more than 2 monitors).


To install, just look for the releases tab(probably on the left) ant download the executable file. (It should work perfectly)


  AS A REMINDER: THIS WAS ALL CODED WITH CHATGPT!!!!
